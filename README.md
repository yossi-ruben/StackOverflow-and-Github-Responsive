The purpose of this Chrome Extension is to dynamically resize the pages for Github and Stackoverflow. 

## Problem to Solve
The issue reveals itself when one has thier text editor, terminal and brower open at the same time and want to view them all simultaneouslyg. Github and Stackoverflow do not dynamically resize themselves and rely on the user either clicking on the browser to take up the entire screen or continuously scrolling side to side.


## To Do
- [ ] Account for all divs that are hard set
- [ ] Set allow for flexibility with page size
